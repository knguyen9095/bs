# BudgetSmart


(Still in development)
The project idea originally came from my group project for CMPS 121 (Mobile Applications).
The difference between the group project BudgetSmart and this BudgetSmart is that the group project used sharedPreferences and was contributed with my other team members.
This version of BudgetSmart is only built by me and I used firebase database method to write and retrieve data per user.

You can see the difference in coding (beside the UI aspect I added in).

What is BudgetSmart?
It's a budgeting app created specifically for people who live paycheck to paycheck. This app is specifically for future planning, but it also can be current planning. The goal of BudgetSmart is to allow easy budgeting for short time intervals. This allows our users to see their past purchases and necessary future expenses. BudgetSmart allows them to make quick educated decisions what purcahses they can afford; however, the true deciding factor is the user. 

Features:
Set Time Intervals - Count down to days.
Set Budget - Keep track of their total budget
Input expected purchases -  decrement the cost from the current budget
Delete expected purchases - increment the cost from the current budget

Future Features in Development:
- When it goes over budget - sort only optional tags from highest to lowest cost value
- break down of how they spend on money via pie chart
- allow users to see past history from different month / time intervals
- share data / history to friends
- implement camera API that read from the recipet and register the name / cost.
